I am unwilling to say that the giving of the pap to sucking animals might have become Juno rather than Jupiter, especially when there was the goddess Rumina to help and to serve her in this work; for I think it may be replied that Juno herself is nothing else than Jupiter, according to those verses of Valerius Soranus, where it has been said:</p><p>"Almighty Jove, progenitor of kings, and things, and gods,<br>And eke the mother of the gods," etc.</p><p>Why, then, was he called Ruminus, when they who may perchance inquire more diligently may find that he is also that goddess Rumina?</p></div> </div>
