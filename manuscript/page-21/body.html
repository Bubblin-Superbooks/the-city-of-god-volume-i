And in the interesting series of letters that passed between Ludovicus Vives and Erasmus, who had engaged him to write a commentary on the <em>City of God</em> for his edition of Augustine's works, we find Vives pleading for a separate edition of this work, on the plea that, of all the writings of Augustine, it was almost the only one read by patristic students, and might therefore naturally be expected to have a much wider circulation.</p></div> </div>
